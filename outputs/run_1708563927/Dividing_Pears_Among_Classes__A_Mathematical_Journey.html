                <p>Dividing resources fairly is a common problem that can be solved using basic mathematical operations. In this article, we will explore how to solve a problem involving the distribution of 40 pears among three classes, ensuring fairness and equality. This scenario not only tests our mathematical skills but also teaches valuable lessons about resource allocation.</p>
                <p>The problem at hand requires us to give 20 pears to one class and divide the rest equally between the other two classes. To tackle this, our first step involves subtraction. We start with a total of 40 pears and need to allocate 20 to one class. This initial step is crucial because it helps us determine the quantity of the resource (pears) we have left for equal distribution.</p>
                <p>Subtracting the 20 pears given to the first class from the total, we find that we are left with 20 pears. This calculation, $40 - 20 = 20$, is straightforward but essential. It sets the stage for the next step, ensuring that we are working with the correct number of pears to be divided among the remaining classes.</p>
                <p>With 20 pears remaining, we now face the task of dividing them equally between two classes. This is where division comes into play. By dividing the 20 pears by the number of remaining classes, which is 2, we ensure that each class receives an equal share. The calculation $20 / 2 = 10$ reveals that each of the two classes should receive 10 pears.</p>
                <p>This problem illustrates how subtraction and division can be used in tandem to solve resource allocation issues. By carefully following these steps, we ensure that each class is treated fairly, with one receiving 20 pears and the other two receiving 10 pears each. This methodical approach to problem-solving can be applied to a wide range of scenarios, making it a valuable skill in both academic and real-world contexts.</p>
