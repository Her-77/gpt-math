                <p>The concept of averages is a fundamental one in mathematics, often employed to summarize datasets. In particular, understanding how the average of a set changes when elements are removed can provide deeper insights into the nature of the data. This article will guide you through the process of finding the new average of a set of numbers after removing some of its elements, using a practical example for clarity.</p>
                <p>To begin, let's consider a set of 50 numbers with an initial average of 83. The average, by definition, is the sum of all numbers in the set divided by the count of the numbers. Therefore, to find the total sum of these numbers, we multiply the average by the count, yielding $50 \times 83 = 4150$. This initial step is crucial as it sets the foundation for the adjustments needed following the removal of numbers from the set.</p>
                <p>The next step involves adjusting the total sum to account for the removal of two numbers, which together sum up to 118. By subtracting this sum from the total sum of the initial set, we adjust the total to reflect the new set of numbers. The calculation is straightforward: $4150 - 118 = 4032$. This new total sum represents the combined value of the remaining 48 numbers in the set.</p>
                <p>With the new total sum at hand, the final step is to calculate the new average. This is done by dividing the new total sum by the new count of numbers in the set. Thus, we have $4032 \div 48 = 84.0$. This result shows us the new average of the set after the removal of the two numbers.</p>
                <p>The process of finding a new average after removing elements from a set involves understanding and applying basic principles of averages and sums. It's a straightforward method but requires careful attention to each step to ensure accuracy. By following the outlined steps, we've found that the new average of the 48 remaining numbers in our example set is 84.0.</p>
