                <p>In the world of mathematics, understanding how to manipulate averages is a crucial skill. Averages give us insight into the central tendency of a dataset, which can be incredibly useful in a variety of fields. Today, we'll explore a fascinating problem: finding the new average of 48 numbers after removing two numbers summing to 118 from a set of 50 numbers initially averaging 83.</p>
                <p>The first step in solving this problem is to calculate the total sum of the initial 50 numbers. The average of a set of numbers is found by dividing the total sum of the numbers by the count of the numbers. Since we know that the average is 83 and we have 50 numbers, the total sum is calculated as $50 * 83 = 4150$. This sum represents the total of all numbers before any are removed.</p>
                <p>Next, we must adjust this total sum to account for the removal of the two numbers. Given that the sum of these two numbers is 118, we subtract this from our initial total sum. This step is crucial because it updates our total to reflect the current set of numbers, leading us to calculate $(50 * 83) - 118 = 4032$. This new total is what we'll use to find the new average.</p>
                <p>With the adjusted total sum of 4032, we then divide by the new total number of numbers, which is 48, to find the new average. This division is the final step in our journey to find the new average, and it gives us the answer: $((50 * 83) - 118) / 48 = 84$. This result shows us the new average after the removal of the two numbers.</p>
                <p>Understanding the steps to manipulate and recalculate averages after changes in a dataset is a powerful tool in data analysis. By following a logical sequence of calculating the initial total, adjusting for changes, and recalculating the average, we can derive meaningful insights from seemingly complex problems.</p>
