                <p>In the fascinating world of linear algebra, norms play a pivotal role in measuring the size or length of vectors and matrices. Among the various norms, the infinity norm of a matrix, denoted as \\(||A||_{\infty}\\), stands out for its unique definition and significance. This article embarks on a journey to prove that the infinity norm of a matrix A equals the maximum 1-norm of its row vectors, bridging an essential connection between two seemingly disparate concepts.</p>
                <p>To set the stage for our exploration, it's imperative to define the key players in our proof: the infinity norm (\\(||A||_{\infty}\\)) and the 1-norm of a row vector (\\(||a(i)||_1\\)). The infinity norm is calculated as the maximum absolute row sum of the matrix, \\(||A||_{\infty} = \max_{1 \leq i \leq m} \sum_{j}|a(i,j)|\\), while the 1-norm of a row vector is simply the sum of the absolute values of its elements, \\(||a(i)||_1 = \sum_{j}|a(i,j)|\\). Understanding these definitions is foundational for relating the matrix norm to its row vectors' norms.</p>
                <p>Illustrating these concepts through an example can significantly enhance our comprehension. Consider the matrix A = [[1, -2], [-3, 4]]. By applying the definitions, we find that the infinity norm of A, \\(||A||_{\infty}\\), is 7, which is the maximum absolute row sum. Simultaneously, the 1-norms of the row vectors of A are {3, 7}, where the maximum 1-norm also equals 7. This example serves as a precursor to understanding the general proof.</p>
                <p>Delving into the proof, we aim to demonstrate that \\(||A||_{\infty} = \max_{1 \leq i \leq m} ||a(i)||_1\\). The proof hinges on showing that the maximum absolute row sum of the matrix A is equivalent to the maximum of the 1-norms of its row vectors. This equivalence is not merely a coincidence but a fundamental property rooted in the definitions and elemental contributions of each component of the matrix to both norms.</p>
                <p>To solidify our understanding, let's revisit the example matrix A = [[1, -2], [-3, 4]]. We've already established that \\(||A||_{\infty} = 7\\) and that the maximum 1-norm of its row vectors is also 7. This direct comparison between the infinity norm and the maximum 1-norm of the row vectors illustrates the proof's essence: the infinity norm of a matrix is, indeed, equal to the maximum 1-norm of its row vectors. Through logical reasoning and calculated steps, we unveil the intimate connection between these norms, enriching our grasp of linear algebra's nuances.</p>
