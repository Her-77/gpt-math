                <p>Simplifying algebraic expressions is a fundamental skill that every math student needs to master. It not only helps in making complex problems more manageable but also lays the groundwork for more advanced algebraic manipulations. Today, we'll tackle a common type of simplification problem: combining like terms. The example we'll work through is simplifying the expression 	extit{3x + 7 - 2x + 4}.</p>
                <p>First, let's understand what like terms are. Like terms are terms in an algebraic expression that have the same variable raised to the same power. Essentially, they're terms that look alike except for their coefficients (the numbers in front of the variables). In our example, 	extit{3x} and 	extit{-2x} are like terms because they both contain the variable 	extit{x} raised to the first power. Similarly, 	extit{7} and 	extit{4} are like terms because they are both constants.</p>
                <p>Why combine like terms? Simplifying an expression by combining like terms reduces the number of terms, making the expression easier to understand and work with. It's a bit like decluttering a room: by organizing items that are alike, you make the space easier to navigate. In mathematical terms, combining like terms will often make further manipulation or solving of equations more straightforward.</p>
                <p>Let's apply this to our problem. To simplify 	extit{3x + 7 - 2x + 4}, we combine the like terms. We add the coefficients of 	extit{x} terms: 	extit{3x} and 	extit{-2x}, which gives us 	extit{x}. For the constants, we add 	extit{7} and 	extit{4}, resulting in 	extit{11}. Therefore, combining these like terms, we simplify the expression to 	extit{x + 11}.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, the process of simplifying an expression by combining like terms is both straightforward and immensely useful. It's a skill that will greatly assist in solving more complex algebraic problems. As we've seen with the example 	extit{3x + 7 - 2x + 4}, by identifying and combining like terms, we can simplify an expression to 	extit{x + 11}, making it clearer and more concise.</p>
