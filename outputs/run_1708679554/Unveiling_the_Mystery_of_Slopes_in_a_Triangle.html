                <p>When diving into the world of geometry, the concept of slopes plays a pivotal role in understanding the relationships and characteristics of various lines and shapes. Specifically, in the context of triangles formed within a coordinate plane, analyzing the slopes of the sides reveals much about their nature and orientation. This article aims to demystify the process of finding the slopes of lines forming a triangle with vertices A(-1,1), B(1,1), and C(1,-1).</p>
                <p>To commence our exploration, let's focus on the side AB of the triangle. The slope of a line, fundamentally, represents its steepness or inclination and is calculated by the formula (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). Applying this formula to points A(-1,1) and B(1,1), we find that the change in y is 0 (since 1 - 1 = 0), and the change in x is 2 (since 1 - (-1) = 2). This results in a slope of 0/2, which simplifies to 0.0, indicating that line AB is horizontal.</p>
                <p>Next, we turn our attention to line BC. This part of the triangle connects points B(1,1) and C(1,-1). Utilizing the slope formula, the numerator becomes -2 (since -1 - 1 = -2), while the denominator becomes 0 (since 1 - 1 = 0), leading to an undefined slope. In terms of geometry, an undefined slope corresponds to a vertical line, which perfectly describes the orientation of line BC in our coordinate plane.</p>
                <p>Finally, the slope of line AC bridges the gap between the other two slopes and completes the triangular picture. By applying the slope formula to points A(-1,1) and C(1,-1), we observe a numerator of -2 (since -1 - 1 = -2) and a denominator of 2 (since 1 - (-1) = 2), yielding a slope of -1.0. This indicates that line AC descends at a constant rate as it moves from left to right across the plane.</p>
                <p>The process of calculating the slopes of lines AB, BC, and AC within our triangle reveals a fascinating geometric relationship. Slopes, as we've seen, are not merely numbers but are indicative of the orientation and nature of lines in a plane. Through the examples of a horizontal line (AB with a slope of 0.0), a vertical line (BC with an undefined slope), and a descending line (AC with a slope of -1.0), we gain a deeper understanding of how these lines interact to form the shape of a triangle.</p>
