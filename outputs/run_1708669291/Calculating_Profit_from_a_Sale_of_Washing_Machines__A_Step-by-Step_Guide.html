                <p>When it comes to running a business, understanding how to calculate profit is crucial. In this case, we're looking at a store that has sold 100 washing machines at a specific price, with one of them being damaged and sold at a discount. The aim is to find out the total profit made from these sales. The journey to the final answer involves a series of calculated steps, each building upon the last to unravel the mystery of the store's financial outcome.</p>
                <p>The first step in our calculation journey is to determine the cost price of a single washing machine. This is important because the profit for each item sold is calculated based on this initial value. By knowing that the store sells the washing machines at 1200 yuan each for a 20% profit, we can deduce that the selling price (SP) formula is SP = Cost Price (CP) + Profit. From this, we find that the cost price per washing machine is 1000 yuan, calculated by rearranging the formula to CP = 1200 / 1.2.</p>
                <p>Next, we calculate the total cost of purchasing 100 washing machines by the store. This step is vital for understanding the store's initial investment before making sales. By multiplying the cost price of a single washing machine (1000 yuan) by the quantity (100), we find that the total cost amounts to 100,000 yuan. This figure sets the stage for determining the overall profitability of the sales.</p>
                <p>To find out the total revenue, we first need to calculate the selling price of 99 machines at full price and the single damaged machine at half price. The total selling price of the 99 undamaged machines is 118,800 yuan, calculated by multiplying 1200 yuan by 99. Meanwhile, the damaged machine, sold at half price, brings in an additional 600 yuan, making the selling price 600 yuan. Combining these figures, the total revenue from all sales is 119,400 yuan.</p>
                <p>With the total revenue and cost figures at hand, the final step is to calculate the store's total profit from these transactions. By subtracting the total cost (100,000 yuan) from the total revenue (119,400 yuan), we find a total profit of 19,400 yuan. This result not only highlights the financial outcome of the store's sales but also emphasizes the importance of understanding pricing strategies and cost management in business.</p>
