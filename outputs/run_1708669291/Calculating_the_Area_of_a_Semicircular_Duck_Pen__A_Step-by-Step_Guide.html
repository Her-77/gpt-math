                <p>When faced with the task of calculating the area of a semicircular duck pen, it's essential to understand the components that make up the total length of the fence. The given length of 18.84 meters includes both the curved part of the semicircle and the straight part of the fence that lies against a wall. This understanding is crucial as it lays the foundation for applying the correct formulas in the subsequent steps of our calculation.</p>
                <p>To begin unraveling this problem, we must first calculate the radius of the semicircle. The total length of the fence (18.84 meters) is essentially the perimeter of the semicircle, which includes its straight edge (diameter). The formula for the perimeter of a semicircle, when accounting for the diameter, is given by $P = \pi r + 2r$, where $r$ is the radius. By setting up this equation, we aim to find the value of $r$ that will be pivotal in our further calculations.</p>
                <p>Solving the equation $18.84 = \pi r + 2r$ for $r$ requires a blend of algebraic manipulation and an understanding of linear equations. Isolating $r$ in this context allows us to pinpoint the radius of the semicircle, which is a crucial step towards determining its area. Through careful calculations, the radius is found to be approximately $3.664$ meters.</p>
                <p>With the radius now known, we can directly calculate the area of the semicircle. The formula used to find the area of a semicircle is $A = (\pi r^2)/2$. This formula takes into account that a semicircle is essentially half of a full circle, hence the division by 2. Substituting the value of $r$ we found into this formula, we proceed to calculate the area of the semicircular duck pen.</p>
                <p>Upon calculation, the area of the semicircular duck pen is found to be approximately $21.1$ square meters. This result is derived by substituting $3.664$ for $r$ in the area formula and executing the arithmetic operation. Thus, with a methodical approach and understanding of the underlying mathematics, we have successfully determined the area of the semicircular duck pen enclosed by an 18.84 meter long fence against a wall.</p>
